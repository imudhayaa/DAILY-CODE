Implement an autocomplete system. That is , given a query string S and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

For ex:
Given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal] return [deer, deal]

CODE:

a=list(input().split())
b=input()
c=[]
for i in a:
    if b in i:
        c.append(i)
print(c)
