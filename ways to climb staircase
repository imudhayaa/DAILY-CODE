There exists a staircase with N steps , and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N , write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For eg:
If N is 4, then there are unique ways:

1,1,1,1,
2,1,1,
1,2,1
1,1,2
2,2,

What if , instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. You could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For eg: if x={1,3,5}, you could climb 1, 3 or 5 steps at at time

CODE:

a=int(input())
b=1
c=2
if a==1:
    print(b)
elif a==2:
    print(c)
else:
    for i in range(3,a+1):
        d=b+c
        b=c
        c=d
    print(d)
